![alt](input/copito_nn.png)

A pre-trained NN says it's probable that Copito is a sheep. If 31.13% is he higher score, it means at least there are 3 other classes with lower probability. 
Supposing that *dog* gets the second biggest probability with 31.10%... What the hack could be the other classes? Polar bear? cotton?  Four-legged goddess?
